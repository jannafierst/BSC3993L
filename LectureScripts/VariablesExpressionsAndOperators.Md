# This script contains code associated with Lecture 3, Variables, Expressions and Operators. The indented blocks are code for you to input to the Python interpreter.

Python as a calculator

        6+5
        a = 6+5
        print(a) # Here, a is a variable that we have assigned the value 11 to
        print(‘a’) # Here, a is a string. Python knows this because of the single quotation marks

We ask the computer to work with values. What is a value?

A letter, a number
Technically, it is an expression that can not be further evaluated

For example, 3 is a value
a is a value

2+1 can be evaluated to 3
a*7 can be evaluated to 7a

Values are of different types

Common Python built-in types include
int - integers
0,1,2

float - floating point numbers
0.1, 1.356

complex - complex numbers
5j + 3 -x

str - strings
‘abracadabra’, ‘ABBA’

Boolean
True or False

These also evaluate to ‘0’ or ‘1’ as integers

        b = True
        int(b)

        b = False 
        int(b)
        b = true # What happens?
